# Domestic Violence Prediction

## Project Overview

Domestic violence is a growing societal issue, and data-driven approaches can help in identifying key factors that contribute to it. This project aims to analyze domestic violence data to determine significant socio-economic and demographic indicators that may predict whether a woman is at risk. Using advanced machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, feature engineering, and data visualization, we derive insights that can aid in policy-making and prevention strategies.

The project follows a structured pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, ensuring robustness and interpretability in predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises various factors such as education level, employment status, financial dependency, age, marital status, and prior experiences with violence. These features are a mix of categorical and numerical variables that require proper preprocessing before being used in a predictive model.

### Data Preprocessing Steps

- **Handling Missing Data**: Imputation techniques applied where necessary.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding used for non-numeric attributes.
- **Feature Scaling**: Standardization applied to numerical variables to improve model performance.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization of variable distributions and correlation analysis.

## How to Run the Analysis

1. **Load the dataset** and inspect missing values.
2. **Preprocess the data** by encoding categorical features and scaling numerical ones.
3. **Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify key patterns.
4. **Train the logistic regression model** and optimize hyperparameters.
5. **Evaluate the model** using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Visualize important findings** to highlight significant risk factors.

## Machine Learning Approach

### Model Used: Logistic Regression

- **Why Logistic Regression?**
  - It is interpretable and suitable for binary classification problems.
  - Provides probability estimates, making it useful for risk assessment.
- **Alternative Models Considered**:
  - Random Forest (for better performance but lower interpretability)
  - Support Vector Machine (for complex decision boundaries)

### Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**: Measures overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision**: How many positive predictions were actually correct.
- **Recall**: Ability to identify actual positive cases.
- **F1-score**: Balance between precision and recall.

---

## Results

The model's performance is summarized below:

- **Accuracy:** 70%
- **Precision:** 74%
- **Recall:** 100%
- **F1-score:** 85%

The analysis revealed that the most influential factors affecting domestic violence risk were:

- **Financial dependency**
- **Education level**
- **Marital status**

## Correlation between Education Level and Domestic Violence

The table below shows the relationship between **education level** and the incidence of **domestic violence**, along with the breakdown of **violence cases** and the total number of individuals.

| Education Level | Violence | Violence Count | Total | Percentage (%) |
|-----------------|----------|----------------|-------|----------------|
| 0               | 0        | 18             | 23    | 78.26          |
| 0               | 1        | 5              | 23    | 21.74          |
| 1               | 0        | 2              | 3     | 66.67          |
| 1               | 1        | 1              | 3     | 33.33          |
| 2               | 0        | 42             | 47    | 89.36          |
| 2               | 1        | 5              | 47    | 10.64          |
| 3               | 0        | 199            | 274   | 72.63          |
| 3               | 1        | 75             | 274   | 27.37          |

#### **Key Insights:**
- **Higher Education Levels** are associated with **lower domestic violence rates**.
- **Tertiary education** (Education Level 3) shows the **lowest percentage** of domestic violence (27.37%).
- **Individuals with lower education levels** (0, 1, 2) report higher percentages of domestic violence, with the highest being 89.36% in secondary education (Level 2).

## Challenges & Future Improvements

- **Data Imbalance:** More data collection is needed to reduce bias.
- **Feature Engineering:** Exploring new variables that may improve prediction accuracy.
- **Model Interpretability:** Further analysis using SHAP values for better explainability.
